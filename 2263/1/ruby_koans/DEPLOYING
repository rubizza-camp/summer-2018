= Deploying a new Ruby Koans ZIP file

The "Download" button on the rubykoans.com web-site points to the
download/rubykoans.zip file in the github repository. So to update the
download target on the web-site, just rebuild the .zip file, commit
and push the changes.

    rake package
    git add download
    git push

That's it.
